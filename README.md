# ListLength

This is an experimental challenge when testing and learning the Elixir language. The test was designed by @rocketseat.

In this challenge, you should create a function that, given a list of numbers (example `[1, 3, 6, 43, 6]`), calculates, **recursively**, how many elements there are in the list and returns this value.

For example, we have the following input and output expected by the function that receives the list:

```bash
iex> ListLength.call([1, 2, 3, 5, 7])
...> 5
```
